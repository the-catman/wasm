# What is this repository?

Just some collection of webassembly stuff. Only for proof of concept.

## What do I need to run this

You'll need clang, [wasm2wat](https://github.com/webassembly/wabt) and [wasm2js](https://github.com/webassembly/binaryen), though the latter two are optional, just comment out the code in [here](./stuff/compile.sh).
